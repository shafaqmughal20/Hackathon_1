# Hero Redesign Specification

## 1. Overview
The default hero section of the landing page will be replaced with a custom component focused on a sleek, dark aesthetic. This redesign will improve the visual appeal and user experience of the landing page for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook website.

## 2. Goals
- Replace the default hero section with a custom dark-themed component
- Implement using Docusaurus swizzling techniques
- Create a visually appealing design with a deep dark background and light text
- Provide a clear call-to-action for users to start reading the textbook

## 3. User Scenarios
- As a visitor landing on the homepage, I want to see a modern, sleek design that reflects the advanced nature of physical AI and robotics
- As a user interested in the textbook content, I want to immediately see a clear call-to-action to start reading
- As a user browsing the site, I want the hero section to be visually striking and professional

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Design Requirements
- The hero section must have a deep, sleek dark background (e.g., #121212 or similar charcoal black)
- All primary text (title, tagline) must be bright white or very light gray
- The section must occupy full viewport height (or near full height) on desktop
- Styling must be implemented using CSS Modules for scoped styling

### 4.2 Content Requirements
- Display the project title prominently: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook"
- Include a compelling tagline related to embodied intelligence and ROS 2
- Replace default buttons with a prominent, contrasting call-to-action button

### 4.3 Call-to-Action Requirements
- Create a prominent button with contrasting color (cyan or electric blue)
- Button text must be "Start Reading the Textbook"
- Button must link directly to the documentation root (/docs/)
- Button must be visually distinct and encourage user interaction

### 4.4 Technical Requirements
- Implement using Docusaurus swizzling to override the default Home page or Hero component
- Use CSS Modules (e.g., styles.module.css) for styling to ensure scoped CSS
- Maintain responsiveness across different device sizes
- Ensure accessibility standards are met

## 5. Success Criteria
- Users can see the new dark-themed hero section on the landing page
- The hero section occupies full viewport height on desktop devices
- The "Start Reading the Textbook" button is prominently displayed and functional
- The design meets the specified color scheme requirements
- The page loads without errors and maintains Docusaurus functionality
- The component is responsive and accessible

## 6. Scope
### In Scope
- Design and implementation of the dark-themed hero section
- Swizzling the appropriate Docusaurus component
- Creating CSS Module for styling
- Implementing the call-to-action button with proper linking
- Ensuring responsive design

### Out of Scope
- Changing other sections of the website beyond the hero section
- Modifying the overall site navigation
- Updating content outside of the hero section
- Implementing animations or advanced effects (unless simple CSS transitions)

## 7. Assumptions
- The current site is built with Docusaurus and supports swizzling
- The existing landing page component can be overridden using Docusaurus conventions
- The site already has a /docs/ route that serves the textbook content
- Standard accessibility practices will be sufficient for this component

## 8. Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with Docusaurus framework
- CSS must be properly scoped using modules to avoid conflicts
- Page load performance should not be significantly impacted
- The design must be responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices

## 9. Key Entities
- Hero section component
- CSS Module stylesheet
- Landing page (Home component)
- Call-to-action button
