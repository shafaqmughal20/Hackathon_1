# Create Physical AI Textbook Specification

## User Prompt
```
/sp.specify

We need a comprehensive technical textbook structure.

Title: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Required Chapters (Create these as MDX files in /docs):

1. Introduction to Embodied Intelligence.

2. ROS 2 Basics (Nodes, Topics, Services).

3. Simulating with Gazebo (World creation, Physics).

4. NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Gym (Reinforcement Learning).

5. Real-World Humanoid Control.



Requirements:

- Clean, technical writing style.

- Include code blocks for ROS 2 commands.

- Update docusaurus.config.js with project title and tagline.
```

## Response Summary
Successfully created a comprehensive technical textbook structure for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics". Updated the Docusaurus configuration with the new project title and tagline. Created 5 required MDX files in the /docs directory covering all specified topics with clean technical writing style and appropriate code blocks. Updated the sidebar configuration to include the new textbook chapters in a structured manner.

## Outcome
- Updated docusaurus.config.js with project title "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" and tagline "A Comprehensive Guide to Embodied Intelligence and Robotic Systems"
- Created 5 MDX files in /docs directory with comprehensive content:
  1. Introduction to Embodied Intelligence
  2. ROS 2 Basics (Nodes, Topics, Services) with code examples
  3. Simulating with Gazebo (World creation, Physics) with examples
  4. NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Gym (Reinforcement Learning) with code
  5. Real-World Humanoid Control with implementation details
- Updated sidebars.js to create a structured textbook navigation
- Ensured clean technical writing style with appropriate code blocks throughout

## Evaluation
All requirements have been met with well-structured, technical content appropriate for a robotics textbook.
