## Prompt Text
```
/sp.tasks

Read .spec/plan.md and generate a granular, ordered checklist in **.spec/tasks.md**.
```

## Response Text
Created a comprehensive granular task checklist in .spec/tasks.md based on the implementation plan. The tasks are organized into four phases:

1. Phase 1: Setup and Component Identification (tasks for identifying the current component and executing swizzling)
2. Phase 2: Component Development (tasks for creating the component structure, styling, layout, and CTA button)
3. Phase 3: Integration and Testing (tasks for integration, responsive design, accessibility, and various testing)
4. Phase 4: Validation and Completion (tasks for validating success criteria and final checks)

The checklist includes 36 specific tasks across these phases, with detailed subtasks for each major component of the implementation. Each task is marked with a checkbox for tracking completion. The tasks cover all aspects of the hero redesign including visual design, functionality, accessibility, and responsive behavior.

## Outcome
Successfully created a detailed, granular task checklist that breaks down the implementation plan into specific, actionable items that can be completed sequentially to achieve the hero redesign goal.
