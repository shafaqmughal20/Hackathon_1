# Implement Textbook Structure

## User Prompt
```
/sp.implement

1. Update docusaurus.config.js first.

2. Delete existing 'tutorial' and 'blog' folders to clean up.

3. Generate the MDX files for the 5 chapters defined in requirements.

4. Update sidebars.js to reflect the new structure.
```

## Response Summary
Successfully implemented the textbook structure by completing all requested tasks:
1. Updated docusaurus.config.js with proper GitHub organization name and removed blog configuration
2. Deleted tutorial and blog folders to clean up the project
3. Verified that MDX files for the 5 required chapters already existed with appropriate content
4. Verified that sidebars.js was properly configured for the textbook structure
