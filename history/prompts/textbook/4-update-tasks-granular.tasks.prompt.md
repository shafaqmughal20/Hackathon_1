# Update Tasks to Be Granular

## User Prompt
```
/sp.tasks

Ensure tasks are granular (e.g., "Write Chapter 1", "Write Chapter 2").
```

## Response Summary
Updated the tasks.md file to have more granular tasks as requested. The tasks have been restructured to be more specific and actionable, with separate tasks for each chapter and configuration element. The tasks now reflect the current state of the project where chapter files already exist, focusing on review and refinement rather than creation.

## Outcome
- Updated tasks.md with granular tasks for each configuration element
- Created specific tasks for reviewing each of the 5 textbook chapters
- Adjusted content tasks to focus on refinement rather than initial creation since content already exists
- Maintained the 3-phase structure while making tasks more specific and actionable

## Evaluation
The tasks are now appropriately granular with specific, actionable items for each aspect of the textbook implementation.
