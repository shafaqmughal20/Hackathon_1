# Plan Physical AI Textbook Implementation

## User Prompt
```
/sp.plan

Break down the work into 3 phases:

1. Configuration (docusaurus.config.js cleanup).

2. Content Skeleton (Creating folders and files for chapters).

3. Content Filling (Writing the actual text and code examples for chapters).
```

## Response Summary
Created a comprehensive 3-phase implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. Developed detailed specification (spec.md), implementation plan (plan.md), and specific tasks (tasks.md) for each phase. The plan accounts for the current state where much of the content has already been created, focusing on configuration cleanup, content organization, and refinement.

## Outcome
- Created spec.md: Detailed requirements and objectives for the textbook
- Created plan.md: High-level 3-phase implementation strategy
- Created tasks.md: Specific, actionable tasks for each phase
- All artifacts follow proper naming and are placed in the specs/textbook/ directory
- Plan addresses configuration, content skeleton, and content filling as requested

## Evaluation
The plan provides a clear roadmap for completing the textbook project with well-defined phases, specific tasks, and measurable outcomes.
