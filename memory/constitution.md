# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Content Excellence
All content must be accurate, accessible, and pedagogically sound. Technical explanations should be clear and well-structured with appropriate examples. Every page must serve a clear educational purpose and contribute to learning objectives.

### II. Docusaurus Standard Implementation
Use Docusaurus v3 standard features and best practices. Leverage built-in components, standard sidebar navigation, and established patterns. Avoid custom complex implementations that could hinder maintainability.

### III. Static Content Focus (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Maintain focus on static educational content. No backend functionality should be implemented at this stage. All content should be pre-built and optimized for static hosting on GitHub Pages.

### IV. Accessibility & Inclusive Design
All content and UI must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Provide alternative text for images, proper heading structure, and keyboard navigation support. Ensure content is accessible to diverse learning needs and abilities.

### V. Technical Accuracy & Citations
All technical content about AI, robotics, and physical computing must be fact-checked and properly sourced. Include relevant citations, references, and links to authoritative sources. Technical diagrams and explanations must be precise and current.

### VI. Modular & Scalable Structure
Organize content in logical, modular sections that can grow over time. Use consistent naming conventions and folder structures that support easy navigation and future expansion of topics.

## Technology Constraints

The project will use Docusaurus v3 with React and Tailwind CSS as specified. Deployment target is GitHub Pages with no backend code. All content must be compatible with static site generation and meet GitHub Pages hosting requirements.

## Development Workflow

Content changes must follow a clear review process with technical accuracy verification. All PRs must include content review from domain experts where appropriate. Documentation should be updated alongside content changes, and all changes must build successfully before merging.

## Governance

This constitution governs all development decisions for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. All contributors must adhere to these principles. Amendments require documentation of changes, approval from project maintainers, and consideration of impact on existing content and learning objectives.
