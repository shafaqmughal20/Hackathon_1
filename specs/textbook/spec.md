# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook - Specification

## Project Overview
A comprehensive technical textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics built with Docusaurus. The textbook will cover fundamental concepts of embodied intelligence, ROS 2 basics, simulation environments, reinforcement learning, and real-world humanoid control systems.

## Objectives
- Create an educational resource for students and professionals interested in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics
- Provide practical knowledge with code examples and implementation details
- Cover the entire pipeline from simulation to real-world deployment
- Use modern tools and frameworks (ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac Sim)

## Scope
### In Scope
- 5 comprehensive chapters covering key topics in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- Docusaurus-based static site with proper navigation and structure
- Technical content with code examples and practical implementations
- GitHub Pages deployment configuration

### Out of Scope
- Backend services or dynamic content
- Interactive coding environments
- Video content or multimedia resources

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Content Requirements**
   - Chapter 1: Introduction to Embodied Intelligence
   - Chapter 2: ROS 2 Basics (Nodes, Topics, Services)
   - Chapter 3: Simulating with Gazebo (World creation, Physics)
   - Chapter 4: NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Gym (Reinforcement Learning)
   - Chapter 5: Real-World Humanoid Control

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Clean, technical writing style appropriate for advanced robotics topics
   - Include code blocks for ROS 2 commands and implementations
   - Proper navigation structure for textbook format
   - Responsive design for multiple device types

3. **Configuration Requirements**
   - Update docusaurus.config.js with project title and tagline
   - Configure for GitHub Pages deployment
   - Set up proper sidebar navigation for textbook structure

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Fast loading times for static content
   - Optimized for GitHub Pages hosting
   - Efficient code example rendering

2. **Maintainability**
   - Clear content structure for future updates
   - Consistent formatting and styling
   - Well-documented configuration

3. **Accessibility**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Proper heading structure
   - Keyboard navigation support

## Constraints
- Use Docusaurus standard sidebar (no custom navigation)
- Deploy target: GitHub Pages (no backend code)
- Focus on static educational content
- Clean, technical writing style only

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 5 textbook chapters completed with appropriate content
- [ ] Docusaurus configuration updated with project-specific information
- [ ] Proper navigation structure implemented
- [ ] Site builds successfully and deploys to GitHub Pages
- [ ] All content follows technical writing standards
- [ ] Code examples are accurate and functional
